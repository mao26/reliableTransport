### User Interface


### API Details
External API 
	
	BackEnd 
*Back end sees an exception with the command and sends the Exception back to the GUI
	
	Views/GUI
*Takes a list of objects
*Each object will be drawn on the GUI and it contains flags and variables that determine what the object is and what it looks like
*The view takes a list of objects so that it doesn't matter what or how many objects get passed to the graphics, it can read them regardless 
	
Internal API

	BackEnd
*Turtle object needs:

	1. It's direction
	2. towardsXY turns the turtle to face the xy coordinate
	3. setHeader turns turtle to an absolute header, returns number of degrees moved
	4. boolean penUp or penDown --> 
	5. boolean visible that determines if the turtle is visible

	
	Views/GUI
	
How the two will communicate?
