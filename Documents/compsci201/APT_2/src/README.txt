My name is Mario Oliver
I have been working on these APT's since Monday.
I am taking 101 and 201, so I'm still learning the whole ideology behind 
computer science, while trying to learn both java and python.
I got a lot of help from a bunch of different TA's. I have asked 
many friends a couple of small questions here and there. I have looked up
how to do different methods online, but I have not copied any code, or 
used anyone else's code. However, I have asked for as much help as I could 
possibly get. 
There have not been any questions.
